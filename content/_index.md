At Hike with Tyke, we believe returning dogs to their natural habitat is the best  form of exercise. Hiking is a great way to stimulate their brains while getting a great workout and socializing. Every day is an adventure with our amazing pack. Within this environment, we have seen many improvements in behavior and overall quality of life. In a typical daycare, dogs can often become anxious or overwhelmed, constantly wondering where their parents are or when they will return home. With hiking, the dogs get to spend the day out with their friends, sniffing and exploring new places.
