Hello, my name is Sierra and I am the creator of Hike with Tyke. I was previously the manager of a dog daycare. When the daycare closed down, I couldn’t imagine living without the dogs I had become so attached to. So I worked hard to set up my dog hiking business, and am proud of the company I have created. I now have over 5 years of dog care experience, and cherish the connections I havve made with every dog. I often refer to myself as their “other mother” because I truly love each of them as if they were my own. With my experience and knowledge, parents can count on me to care for their beloved fur babies.

Who is Tyke?
===
Tyke was adopted by Sierra when he was 3 years old. Since then, he has changed human and animal lives alike in so many ways. Tyke is an amazing mentor to the other dogs and an amazing pack leader. He is kind, loving, and excited to see his friends every day. Tyke is great at walking, greeting dogs and humans, gentle with other animals, and is very patient with his crew. He takes his job as pack leader seriously and is always looking out for others. He is everyone’s best friend and we’re all very lucky to have him.


What does a typical hiking day look like?
===
We hike Monday through Friday, rain or shine. We are based in southeast Portland but are available for some pick ups outside of our work zone. Our pick up and drop off times are dependent on where you live. Pick up is usually from 8am-10am and drop off is usually from 3pm-5pm. If you are outside of our work zone, your dog will most likely be picked up last and dropped off first due to traffic. Their hike will not be shortened in any way because if this, only their time in the car. We typically hike in the gorge, but occasionally travel to other locations around Oregon. Our hikes are anywhere from 3-7 miles long, often with some play time at the park afterwards. Hike with Tyke is a great service for dogs who need exercise or a friendly face during the day. Most dogs are tired when returning home and spend the rest of the day relaxing.

Who can join?
===
Because we are hiking in a pack, all dogs are required to pass an assessment before joining the pack. This usually takes about half an hour and will be done on a separate day before hiking. We accept any size or breed of dog over 4 months old. All dogs must be spayed/neutered after one year of age, but some dogs may be asked to be fixed earlier if there are issues. All dogs must be vaccinated for bordetella, DHPP/DAPP, and rabies after one year. Any dog with expired vaccinations will be asked to stay home until they are updated. Due to the environment we hike in, it is *strongly* advised that all dogs be on a flea and tick medication. We are not professional dog trainers and should not be treated as such. Dogs joining our pack should already know basic commands, walk well on a leash, and will be expected to follow our directions. Dogs should have experience with socializing with other dogs and interacting with people. We are here to have fun and need the dogs to be on their best behavior in order to do that.
